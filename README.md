# API Test Script (`apitest.py`)

This script contains automated tests for an API. It is built using **Python** and **requests** library to test different API endpoints and validate their responses.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **pip** (Python's package installer)

You can check if Python and pip are installed by running the following commands:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
If not installed, download and install Python from python.org.

Installation
Clone the repository or download the apitest.py script.

Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt should contain all necessary Python packages (e.g., requests).

Running the Tests
To run the API tests, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python apitest.py
The script will send requests to the specified API endpoints and check if the responses are valid (e.g., status codes, response time, data validation).

Example
If you're testing an endpoint like GET /api/v1/users, the script will verify:

Status code 200 (OK)
Response body contains expected data
Project Structure
apitest.py: The main script that runs the API tests.
requirements.txt: Contains the list of dependencies (e.g., requests).
test_data/: (Optional) Contains any test data or mock data files.
Test Results
The results of the tests will be printed to the console. If a test fails, an error message will provide information about the failure (e.g., expected status code vs. actual).

Example Output:
bash
Copy code
Test passed for GET /api/v1/users
Test failed for POST /api/v1/users: Expected status code 201 but got 400
Customizing the Tests
To customize the tests, you can modify the following in the apitest.py script:

API base URL: Change the base URL of the API you're testing.
Test data: Modify the data used for testing the POST, PUT, or PATCH endpoints.
Assertions: Adjust the assertions based on the expected behavior for each API endpoint.
Running Tests with Different Configurations
You can run tests on different environments or configurations by setting environment variables or editing the configuration directly in the apitest.py script.

Example:
python
Copy code
import os
API_URL = os.getenv('API_URL', 'https://api.example.com')
Set the environment variable for the API URL:

bash
Copy code
export API_URL='https://new-api.example.com'
python apitest.py
